          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I began my journey into programming with a simple Python calculator â€” amazed by how a few lines of code
            could automate tasks and simplify life. That fascination turned into a deep passion for using technology
            to shape the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my proudest accomplishments was a challenging school project where we were asked to "re-invent Microsoft Excel."
            Despite the technical and logistical hurdles â€” including remote collaboration across campuses â€” I successfully
            delivered a well-received solution that impressed peers, tutors, and even the professor. It reminded me that great things
            come from persistence and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            What motivates me most is the desire to solve problems that frustrate people. If something can be improved,
            then it should be â€” and I love being the one who builds those solutions. Iâ€™m flexible when working in teams,
            always adapting to others' preferences to bring out the best result together.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is simple: create, build, and develop meaningful technology for people everywhere.
